<h1>Natas Level 1</h1>
<p>We can now move onto level 1, for which we have to log in with the password we acquired from the previous level.</p>
<p>After logging in, we see a similair webpage but it tells us that right clicking has been blocked.</p>

<p>And, if we try, we can see that right clicking no longer does anything, but that is not the only way to bring up the developer tools menu.</p>
<p>We can press the F12 key on our keyboard and then press the Elements button at the top of the menu to go to the same menu as in level 0.</p>

<p>And if we expand the code seen, then we can once again see the password for the next level, which is: h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7.</p>
