<p>There isn't a lot for us to go off of on this page, so we'll try to dive deeper to see if we can find anything useful hidden in the webpage's HTML code.</p>
<p>To do this we are going to right click anywhere on the page and then press inspect element.</p>

<p>After doing this we are greeted with a screen containing all of the front end code, here we can press the little arrows that I've circled below to expand it.</p>
