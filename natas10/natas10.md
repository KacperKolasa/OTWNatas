<h2>Natas Level 10</h2>
<p>This level looks very similair to the previous one, except it tells us that some characters are filtered.</p>
<p>Lets try a "." again, and we can see that it works as it did before.</p>

<p>Lets now look at the source code to see which characters are filtered.</p>

<p>We can see that the characters ; and & are filtered, but we didn't use any of them to retrieve the last password.</p>
<p>So lets try the same input as last level but changing the natas10 to natas 11.</p>
<p>And when we enter ". /etc/natas_webpass/natas11" we can see the password for the next level</p>
