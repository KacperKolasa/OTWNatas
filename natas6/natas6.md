<h2>Natas Level 6</h2>
<p>When we enter this level, we are met with the following screen:</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4fL5T1f.jpg"/>
<p>We have a text box and a submit button. Whenever we put something in the box and submit it it returns with "Wrong Secret".</p>
<p>There is also a "View sourcecode" button, and if we press it we can see php code for the website, in which we can see a file directory.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U8RBAEY.jpg"/>
<p>We will now try to append that file directory to the end of our URL to see if we can find anything.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PPvd84z.jpg"/>
<p>We do indeed have access to this file and it gives us a string labelled secret.</p>
<p>We will now go back to the home page and enter this string into the text box.</p>

<p>And there is our password for the next level.</p>
